# 🧠 Patterns Battleground

**Patterns Battleground** is an educational project designed to deeply understand **Design Patterns** in **C#**. It combines theory, clean implementation, and unit testing to help you learn **how**, **when**, and **why** to use design patterns in real-world scenarios.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

> **Turn theory into working code. Understand, don’t memorize.**

This project is for developers — like myself — who want to:
- Learn by doing, not memorizing,
- Implement modern C# solutions (C# 10+),
- Build testable, maintainable pattern-based code,
- Strengthen their portfolio and technical interview skills.

## 🧩 Repository Contents

Patterns are grouped into their classic categories:

### 🔧 Creational Patterns
- [x] Factory Method
- [x] Abstract Factory
- [x] Builder
- [x] Singleton
- [x] Prototype

### 🧱 Structural Patterns
- [x] Adapter
- [x] Bridge
- [x] Composite
- [x] Decorator
- [x] Facade
- [x] Flyweight
- [x] Proxy
      
### 🔄 Behavioral Patterns
- [ ] Strategy
- [ ] Observer
- [ ] Command
- [ ] State
- [ ] Template Method
- [ ] Visitor
- [ ] Chain of Responsibility
- [ ] Mediator
- [ ] Memento
- [ ] Interpreter
- [ ] Iterator

Each pattern includes:
- ✔️ Realistic, standalone code example,
- ✔️ Clean and modern class structure,
- ✔️ Unit tests in `xUnit`,
- ✔️ Comments and explanations,
- ✔️ Educational sub-project in a dedicated folder.

## 💡 Future Plans

- [ ] Add an example and corresponding tests for every design pattern
